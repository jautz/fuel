# fuel

Calculate fuel consumption and costs.

The data is taken from an XML file that has to be edited manually,
i.e. there is no user interface to enter new data.

An example .fuel.xml is included to describe the expected data.
Copy it to your $HOME and adapt it. Sorry, no XSD yet.

*Disclaimer*: This is a rather old script, written in 2003.
As you can see, there are lots of possibilities for improvement.
It fulfilled my modest needs, however, during the last decade.
